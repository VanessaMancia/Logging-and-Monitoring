# Logging-and-Monitoring

In this lab we will use 2 GeoIP files which will help us correlate IP addresses to figure out where the attacks originated from. 
This will be interesting because in Event Viewer we only see IP addresses, but we have no clue where the attacks came from. 


We will first download 2 GeoIP files
